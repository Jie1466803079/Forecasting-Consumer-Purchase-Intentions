# Forecasting-Consumer-Purchase-Intentions
In this project, I employed the Big Data Analytics Lifecycle framework to meticulously analyze the given dataset. After identifying pivotal attributes, I executed an ETL process to ensure data integrity. I also standardized the data. Utilizing this cleansed data, I developed both Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classifier models to forecast customer purchasing behaviours. After conducting a thorough performance evaluation, I determined that the Naive Bayes Classifier outperformed Logistic Regression, making it the better choice to drive the company's strategic insights. This model boasts an impressive prediction accuracy of 95%.
