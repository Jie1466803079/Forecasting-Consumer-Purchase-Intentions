# Forecasting-Consumer-Purchase-Intentions
In this project, I employed the Big Data Analytics Lifecycle framework to meticulously analyze the given dataset. After identifying pivotal attributes, I executed an ETL process to ensure data integrity. Furthermore, I leveraged data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset's distribution and patterns. I also used the heatmap to explore relationships between variables. Visualizations aided in understanding the data's characteristics and identifying potential areas for feature engineering or selection. I also standardized the data to improve the model performance. I processed the data and built Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classifier models to predict customer buying patterns. While training these models, I addressed the issue of class imbalance. I also divided the dataset into various subsets for training and performance evaluation. To evaluate the efficacy of the models, I utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and the confusion matrix. After conducting a thorough performance evaluation, I determined that the Naive Bayes Classifier outperformed Logistic Regression, making it the better choice to drive the company's strategic insights. This model boasts an impressive prediction accuracy of 95%.
